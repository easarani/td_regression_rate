## Fall 2019 Data Analytics
Notes, Code Samples, Exercises, and Project Instructions for the [OKCoders Data Analytics Boot Camp](https://www.okcoders.com/blog/data-analytics-bootcamp-fall-2019-in-okc).


### Scope of the Course
This 8-week introductory bootcamp will cover the basics of data analytics using SQL and Python. During the 8 weeks youâ€™ll learn how to work with a relational SQL database, how to break down analytical questions into small sub-problems, and how to solve each with the Python programming language. The class will cover the basics of working with data, statistical modeling, and some application of machine learning. This will include the completion of 2 analytical projects that can be shown in a code portfolio. The bootcamp is intended for beginners, but experienced developers are welcome as well.


### Technology Used in this Course
+ [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL): The Structured Query Language (SQL) is the primary method for interacting with [Relational Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database). A Relational Database is a place to house data that neatly fits into rows and columns (think Excel, but far more powerful and scalable). We will use SQL to interact with data, do simple data connection and formatting operations, and even interact with SQL from inside the analytics pipelines we will write in R.

+ [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite): The specific relational database engine and environment we are going to use will be SQLite (pronounced "Sequel Light"). SQLite is an entire database that saves to a single file. We will be able to interact with all major SQL commands using this light weight database, as well as connect to it directly with R to incorporate SQL and R programming pipelines together.
